        <h1>About me</h1>
        <div class="text-grey">
            <p>Hi friend! I see you somehow stumbled upon my website and are now wondering who I am. Well, I am an
                undergraduate student studying towards a Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering. But that is
                not all that defines me.</p>
            <p>I am a dreamer and one of my dreams is to be a pillar of inspiration, a leading lady. As a woman in STEM
                and a person of colour, I love empowering and learning more about my community and others who surround
                me. Helping people is always a joyful experience and I extend that joy through leadership. Its doubly
                rewarding in the sense that I get to learn and improve as a person while gaining satisfaction.
                Satisfaction, however, has many roads. I like to partake in a variety of hobbies and extraneous
                volunteer roles in the community to quench my ongoing thirst for stimulation. Boredom is my kryptonite
                that follows me everywhere I go which is why you will soon discover the lack of a pattern in my
                experiences.</p>
            <p> My interest for computer science was sparked in middle school. I started off with web development and
                coding simple calculators on notepad with C code. From then on, my interest only grew more and more.
                While living the life of a perpetual student, I recently rekindled my interest for Cyber security and
                now yearn to learn more about AI. Even though I am studying in a field that is more prone to saturation
                in the consumer market, I recognize the versatility of my education and want to use that to my advantage.
                I want to help people. Whether directly or indirectly is up to the opportunities that the lie ahead. But
                what I truly desire is to work in public safety, space and defense, or support the battle for
                sustainability. </p>
            <p>Now that I rambled on without saying much, have a gander at my website if you wish to learn more. Feel
                free to contact me with constructive criticism if something really irks you while you're browsing.</p>
            <p>Cheerio! <br>- Fareen Lavji</p>
